#Create a Git repository
As our new Bitbucket space station administrator, you need to be organized. When you make files for your space station, you’ll want to keep them in one place and shareable with teammates, no matter where they are in the universe. With Bitbucket, that means adding everything to a repository. Let’s create one!

Some fun facts about repositories

You have access to all files in your local repository, whether you are working on one file or multiple files.
You can view public repositories without a Bitbucket account if you have the URL for that repository.
Each repository belongs to a user account or a team. In the case of a user account, that user owns the repository. + In the case of a team, that team owns it.
The repository owner is the only person who can delete the repository. If the repository belongs to a team, an admin can delete the repository.
A code project can consist of multiple repositories across multiple accounts but can also be a single repository from a single account.
Each repository has a 2 GB size limit, but we recommend keeping your repository no larger than 1 GB.
